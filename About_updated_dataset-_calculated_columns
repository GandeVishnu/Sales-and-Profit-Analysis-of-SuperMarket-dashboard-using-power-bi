1. sqrt-sales: This is the square root of the Sales value (352.38).  
   - Calculation: √(352.38) =approx 18.77.
   - Formula: sqrt_sales = Sales ** 0.5.

2. Power-Sales: This involves raising Sales to a high exponent. From the data, this could mean Sales raised to the power of 3 or 4, yielding a large number.
   - Calculation example (hypothetical exponent of 3): ( 352.38^3 =approx 43,755,611.10).
   - Formula: power_sales = Sales ** 3 (or adjust the exponent as needed)

3. round-up: The square root of Sales (18.77) is rounded up to the next decimal.
   - Calculation: ceil(18.77) = 18.78.
   - Formula: round_up = math.ceil(sqrt(Sales))

4. length-cust: This counts the number of characters in the Customer Name (e.g., "Chuck Sachs").
   - Calculation: 11 characters.
   - Formula: length_cust = len(Customer_Name)

5. COST PRICE: Represents the cost calculated by subtracting Profit from Sales.
   - Calculation:  352.38 - 21.0 = 331.38.
   - Formula (based on profit): cost_price = Sales - Profit

6. Profit Percentage: The percentage of Sales represented by Profit.
   - Calculation: (21.0/352.38)*100 =6.34%).
   - Formula: profit_percentage = (Profit / Sales) * 100

7. month of orders: Extracted from the Order Date, representing the month in numeric form.
   - December corresponds to 12.
   - Formula: month_of_orders = Order_Date.month

8. days to shift: This is the number of days between `Order Date` and `Ship Date`.
   - Calculation: Ship Date - Order Date = 6 days.
   - days_to_shift = (Ship_Date - Order_Date).days

9. day of the week: Represents the day of the week for `Order Date`, where typically Monday = 0 and Sunday = 6.
   - For this example, the Order Date falls on a Thursday, which is represented by 4.
   - Formula: day_of_week = Order_Date.weekday()

10. round-down: The square root of Sales (18.77) rounded down.
    - Calculation: floor(18.77) = 18.77.
    - Formula: round_down = math.floor(sqrt(Sales))

11. round: Rounds the square root of Sales (18.77) using standard rounding rules.
    - Result: 18.77 (as it is close to this value already).
    - Formula: rounded = round(sqrt(Sales), 2)

12. AP/Item: Likely represents the average price per item.
    - Calculation: 352.38/7 =8.23.
    - Formula: average_price_per_item = Sales / Quantity

13. Sum-sales: Likely the total Sales across a specific group (e.g., all orders by this customer or in this segment).
    - Here, it’s a large cumulative value:12,642,501.91.
    - Formula (e.g., grouped by Customer ID): sum_sales = df.groupby("Customer ID")["Sales"].transform("sum")

14. av/item(1): Likely an average of Sales across multiple items or transactions.
    - Value: 3 (details on calculation context could vary).
    - Formula: average_item_sales = df["Sales"].mean()

15. ifelse-column: Represents a conditional categorization, likely based on Sales or Profit thresholds.
    - In this example, it’s labeled "low," possibly indicating low profit or sales based on a set condition.
    - felse_column = np.where(profit_percentage > 10, "High", "Low")
16. Sales Priority: 
    Example criteria:
                      Sales > $500 → "High"
                      $200 ≤ Sales ≤ $500 → "Medium"
                      Sales < $200 → "Low"
